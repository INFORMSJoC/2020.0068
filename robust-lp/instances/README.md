# Data and instances for replication

This folder contains the lp instances from the well-known NetLib library.  I
used a script to translate them all into a format that is very easy to read. So
the instances available here actually represent derivative works, constructed
from instances retrieved from the following source:

www.netlib.org/lp/data/index.html

The files ending with `.start` represent starting feasible solutions for the 
main algorithm. They were generated by calling `./main` with `wstart` as 
the first argument.
